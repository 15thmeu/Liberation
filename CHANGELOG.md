# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/). Legacy releases used an incrementing `R#` version scheme. Releases based on KP-Liberation v0.96.7a and greater adhere to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) and begin at v1.1.0 (as legacy releases would be v1.0).
