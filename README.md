## 15th MEU Realism Unit

We are an Arma 3 realism unit with a very high view of the US Marine Corps, and a very high view on realistic gaming. We gather and play to simulate a Marine Corps environment, in honor of the real Leathernecks who serve.

The 15th MEU Realism Unit is one of the longest standing realism units within the Arma community, having been activated in June 2007. Since that time we have experienced many expansions and reductions, and various changes of command. Our foundation is solid, having stood some of the toughest tests realism gaming, and group gaming as a whole, can muster. We are here to stay, and will continue to set the standard for realism gaming as our founders laid the basis for, even thought they have long departed our ranks.

## Customizations

This project is designed to give the public Arma 3 community a taste of what it is like to be a member in the 15th MEU Realism Unit. Assets and equipment are limited to what is used by the US Marine Corps and the 15th MEU Realism Unit. The mission is intended to be run with a specific set of CBA settings that mirror the 15th MEU Realism Unit's operational settings.

* Vehicle build list reworked to favour USMC and 15th MEU Realism Unit assets.
* Custom map templates: [Isla Abramia], [Lingor], [Virolahti].
* Custom factions using RHS and 3CB Factions.
